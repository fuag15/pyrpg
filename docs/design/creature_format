Currently, creatures should be in a directory reflecting CREATURE_TYPE and be named CREATURE_SUBTYPE:

/creatures/CREATURE_TYPE/CREATURE_SUBTYPE
eg
/creatures/dragons/green

modifiers should be in /creatures/modifiers/MODIFIER_NAME such as:

/creatures/modifiers/dire


In definition files:
var = value

action: [dependancy1, dependancy2, ..., dependancyN]
    description = This describes the action
    aliases = AlternateName1, ... AlternateNameN
    roll = XdY [(+, -, *, /) N 
    arbitraryVar = value

Example contents of a CREATURE_SUBTYPE:

size = huge
description = This is a creature of some sort

full attack: short sword, short sword
    description =  full round action
    alias = full
    

short sword:
    description = an attack with a short sword
    alias = shortsword, sw
    damage = 2d8 +1
